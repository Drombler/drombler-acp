{"name":"Drombler ACP","tagline":"Drombler Abstract Client Platform (ACP) - an abstract, GUI-toolkit agnostic, modular Rich Client Platform ","body":"*Drombler Abstract Client Platform (ACP)* is an abstract, GUI-toolkit agnostic, modular Rich Client Platform based on:\r\n\r\n * **OSGi**: *OSGi* is the de facto standard for writing modular software in *Java*.\r\n * **Maven (POM-first)**: *Drombler ACP* applications can build with *Maven*. The build follows the standard POM-first approach (the OSGi meta data will be generated for you).\r\n * **Declarative programming model**: Annotations can be used at many places to register elements such as menus, toolbars and GUI components.\r\n * **Drombler Commons**: *Drombler Commons* is a collection of reusable libraries and frameworks. They ship with OSGi meta data but don't require an OSGi environment.
