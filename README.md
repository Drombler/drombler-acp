# Drombler ACP

*Drombler Abstract Client Platform (ACP)* is an abstract, GUI-toolkit agnostic, modular Rich Client Platform based on:

 * **OSGi**: *OSGi* is the de facto standard for writing modular software in *Java*.
 * **Maven (POM-first)**: *Drombler ACP* applications can build with *Maven*. The build follows the standard POM-first approach (the OSGi meta data will be generated for you).
 * **Declarative programming model**: Annotations can be used at many places to register elements such as menus, toolbars and GUI components.
 * **Drombler Commons**: *Drombler Commons* is a collection of reusable libraries and frameworks. They ship with OSGi meta data but don't require an OSGi environment. Read more about *Drombler Commons* here: [Drombler Commons](https://github.com/Drombler/drombler-commons)

See the [documentation](https://www.drombler.org/drombler-acp) for the Javadoc and information about the provided Maven modules (available from Maven Central).
